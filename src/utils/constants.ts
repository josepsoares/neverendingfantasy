      "Final Fantasy series is anything but 'Final', it just won't stop growing and evolving. To call this series 'Final' is no longer ironic it's pratically sarcasm at this point. Nedless to say Final Fantasy is a very important franchise to me and who I am as gamer. Despite my countless efforts I can't complete these bad boys back, to back, to back, but, if I could I would"
